Prediction-of-Covid-19

The outbreak of this deadly virus has brought the world to a standstill. Corona Virus has taken over the world affecting 5 million people according to the recent updates from the World Health Organization. This virus has caused thousands of deaths around the world. However, the symptoms of COVID-19 are unpredictable, it may not even initially cause any symptoms for some people, yet the onset of this virus has been seen with few common  symptoms like shortness of breath, fever, cough and cold. In this project, we have collected the original dataset to predict the future occurrence of COVID-19.  The model predicts the presence of the virus based on the travel history, native of Wuhan and symptoms like fever, cough and pneumonia. The machine model is built on logistic regression.

Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.

This data set provides us information to help you predict the occurrence of Covid â€“ 19 in people based on 8 parameters (Age, Sex, Visited Wuhan, Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Pneumonia, Asymptomatic) against the target variable (Result) 

From the original dataset, the symptoms column was used to extract the most common symptoms of corona virus in order to predict the occurrence of it.
